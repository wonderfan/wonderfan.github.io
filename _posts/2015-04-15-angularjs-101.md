### AngularJS Introduction
---
AngularJS lets you write client-side web applications as if you had a smarter browser. It lets you use good old HTML (or HAML, Jade and friends!) as your template language and lets you extend HTML’s syntax to express your application’s components clearly and succinctly. It automatically synchronizes data from your UI (view) with your JavaScript objects (model) through 2-way data binding. To help you structure your application better and make it easy to test, AngularJS teaches the browser how to do dependency injection and inversion of control. Oh yeah and it also helps with server-side communication, taming async callbacks with promises and deferreds; and makes client-side navigation and deeplinking with hashbang urls or HTML5 pushState a piece of cake. The best of all: it makes development fun!


### Source code Anatomy of AngularJS
---

+ anchorScroll.js
```js
    function scroll() {
      var hash = $location.hash(), elm;

      // empty hash, scroll to the top of the page
      if (!hash) $window.scrollTo(0, 0);

      // element with given id
      else if ((elm = document.getElementById(hash))) elm.scrollIntoView();

      // first anchor with given name :-D
      else if ((elm = getFirstAnchor(document.getElementsByName(hash)))) elm.scrollIntoView();

      // no element and hash == 'top', scroll to the top of the page
      else if (hash === 'top') $window.scrollTo(0, 0);
    }

```
+ animate.js
```js
  this.register = function(name, factory) {
    var key = name + '-animation';
    if (name && name.charAt(0) != '.') throw $animateMinErr('notcsel',
        "Expecting class selector starting with '.' got '{0}'.", name);
    this.$$selectors[name.substr(1)] = key;
    $provide.factory(key, factory);
  };
```

+ document.js
```js
function $DocumentProvider(){
  this.$get = ['$window', function(window){
    return jqLite(window.document);
  }];
}
```

+ controller.js
```js
instance = $injector.instantiate(expression, locals);
locals.$scope[identifier] = instance;
```

+ location.js
```js
var PATH_MATCH = /^([^\?#]*)(\?([^#]*))?(#(.*))?$/,
    DEFAULT_PORTS = {'http': 80, 'https': 443, 'ftp': 21};
```
